# Architecture Diagram Images

This directory will contain rendered versions of the Mermaid diagrams.

To generate these images, you can use:
1. GitHub's built-in Mermaid rendering when viewing the markdown files
2. The Mermaid Live Editor (https://mermaid.live/)
3. GitHub Actions to automatically render the diagrams

The main architecture diagrams are:

1. `high_level_architecture.png` - Shows the overall system architecture
2. `detailed_component_architecture.png` - Shows the detailed components
